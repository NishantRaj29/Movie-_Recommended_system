# Movie_Recommended_system

This model aims to recommend the movie to the user on the basis of kind of movie the user like. 

## Dataset
The model is trained using the dataset of form CSV file, which consist of movies name and their corresponding details.

The columns present in the dataset are:

1. Genre
2. Keywords
3. Tagline
4. Cast 
5. Director

## Technologies Used
The following libraries have been used in the implementation of this model:

1. Numpy
2. Panda
3. Cosine_similarity
4. Difflib

## Implementation
We start with the data exploration and analysis.Then select the relevant feature for feature selection such as genre,cast,director,etc.
Combine all the selected feature.Then to implement machine learning algorithm we will convert the text data to numerical data.
